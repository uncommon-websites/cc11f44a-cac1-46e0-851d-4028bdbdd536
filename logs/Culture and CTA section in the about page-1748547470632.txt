Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\\\\\\\",\\\\n38: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\\\\\\\",\\\\n39: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence.

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership.

Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}],"finishReason":"tool-calls","usage":{"promptTokens":12531,"completionTokens":21,"totalTokens":12552},"warnings":[],"request":{"body":"{\"model\":\"gpt-4.1\",\"temperature\":1,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"\\nYou are UNC, Uncommon's AI-powered designer specialized in web development and crafting beautiful websites with Apple-like copy.\\n\\n## Your role\\n- Follow user instructions precisely and only edit what is explicitly requested\\n- Leverage available tools:\\n  - `view_file`: View file content.

It works well for these reasons:\\n        Immediately acknowledges a widespread pain point (nobody loves email)\\n        \\\"We all\\\" creates a sense of shared experience and community around the core problem\\n        Creates curiosity about how Cora might solve this universal challenge when everyone before them has come up short\\n        The brevity and directness avoids marketing hype and instead encourages potential users to simply try it for themselves\\n        Opens with a problem statement that primes users to be receptive to Cora's solution\\n        Uses \\\"dread\\\" which is a strong emotional word that resonates with many (all?) email users\\n        The simple and conversational tone feels authentic and relatable\\n        Avoids technical language while still identifying the problem that Cora aims to address\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Science you can hear</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nBrain.fm's marketing headline on their /science page is \\\"Science you can hear\\\". This clever H1 works well for these reasons:\\nCreates an intriguing sensory connection between actual scientific research and the audio experience of Brain.fm\\nSuggests evidence-based functionality without using technical or academic jargon\\nImplies that Brain.fm has translated complex neuroscience into an accessible audio format to help with deep work\\n\\\"You can hear\\\" emphasizes the actual user experience\\nIn just four words this headline is memorable while still communicating the core value\\nBalances credibility (science) with practicality (you can hear)\\nDistinguishes Brain.fm from ordinary music services by emphasizing scientific foundation\\nCreates curiosity about how science can be transformed into something audible in a way that can also help you improve tasks throughout your daily life\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The spreadsheet you've always wanted</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEquals' marketing headline \\\"The spreadsheet you've always wanted\\\" stands out and works well for a handful of reasons:\\nUses \\\"The\\\" rather than \\\"A\\\" to position itself as the definitive solution to spreadsheet needs\\n\\\"You've always wanted\\\" implies that existing spreadsheet solutions have left users wanting more\\nCreates curiosity about what makes this spreadsheet different from others\\nSimple and direct in a way that makes the value proposition immediately clear\\nSpeaks to both existing spreadsheet users and those who've avoided them due to limitations (big market)\\nThe personal address makes users feel seen and understood\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>If you can edit text, you can make viral clips.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nDescript's homepage rotates through three marketing headlines, but the headline \\\"If you can edit text, you can make viral clips.\\\" is the most effective in my opinion. Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}]}]},"providerMetadata":{"openai":{"reasoningTokens":0,"acceptedPredictionTokens":0,"rejectedPredictionTokens":0,"cachedPromptTokens":11136}},"experimental_providerMetadata":{"openai":{"reasoningTokens":0,"acceptedPredictionTokens":0,"rejectedPredictionTokens":0,"cachedPromptTokens":11136}},"isContinued":false},{"stepType":"tool-result","text":"","reasoningDetails":[],"files":[],"sources":[],"toolCalls":[{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh","toolName":"write_copy","args":{"topic":"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \n\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\n\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\\\\\\\",\\\\n38: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\\\\\\\",\\\\n39: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership.

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh","toolName":"write_copy","args":{"topic":"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \n\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\n\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\\\\\\\",\\\\n39: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\\\\\\\"\\\\n40: \\\\t]}\\\\n41: />\\\\n42: \\\\n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\\\\n44: <Culture {values} />\\\\n45: \\\\n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\\\\n47: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n48: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"team\\\\\\\"\\\\n49: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Our team.\\\\\\\"\\\\n50: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Your partners in innovation.\\\\\\\"\\\\n51: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n52: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n53: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Alex Morgan\\\\\\\",\\\\n54: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Founder & CEO\\\\\\\",\\\\n55: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\\\\\\\",\\\\n56: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n57: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n58: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n59: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n60: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Jamie Chen\\\\\\\",\\\\n61: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Chief Design Officer\\\\\\\",\\\\n62: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\\\\\\\",\\\\n63: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n64: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n65: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n66: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n67: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Taylor Wright\\\\\\\",\\\\n68: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Head of Engineering\\\\\\\",\\\\n69: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\\\\\\\",\\\\n70: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n71: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n72: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n73: \\\\t]}\\\\n74: />\\\\n75: \\\\n76: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n77: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"investor\\\\\\\"\\\\n78: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Backed by the best.\\\\\\\"\\\\n79: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\\\\\\\"\\\\n80: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n81: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n82: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Point Nine Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n83: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\\\\\\\"\\\\n84: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n85: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n86: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"TSIC Ventures\\\\\\\",\\\\n87: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\\\\\\\"\\\\n88: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n89: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n90: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Sequoia Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n91: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\\\\\\\"\\\\n92: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n93: \\\\t]}\\\\n94: />\\\\n95: \\\\n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\\\\n97: <CallToAction\\\\n98: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Ready to collaborate?\\\\\\\"\\\\n99: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Let's create something amazing\\\\\\\"\\\\n100: \\\\tdescription=\\\\\\\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\\\\\\\"\\\\n101: />\\\\n102: \\\"\"},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh\",\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"write_copy\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"topic\\\":\\\"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \\\\n\\\\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\\\\n\\\\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh","toolName":"write_copy","args":{"topic":"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \n\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\n\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

Here's why.\\nThe \\\"If you can... you can\\\" structure brilliantly connects a familiar skill that we all have (editing text) to a desirable outcome (creating viral clips). This makes complex video editing and going viral feel accessible.\\n\\\"Viral clips\\\" addresses a creator's aspirations while suggesting Descript can help achieve social media success that they've likely been chasing.\\nThe headline also cleverly implies that Descript makes video editing as simple as text editing, without explicitly stating it.\\nOverall, this headline works by promising to transform a common skill into a desired outcome, making video creation feel approachable while maintaining the aspiration of viral success.\\nOh… and in case you didn't know… there are currently 162 million amateur content creators. That's 162 million people that would love to go viral.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nMuse's marketing headline \\\"Sites & eCom so easy, Grandma can do it.\\\" stands out and certainly stops the scroll.\\nUsing \\\"Grandma\\\" as a proxy for technological inexperience attempts to highlight just how easy Muse it to use. It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\\\\\\\",\\\\n38: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\\\\\\\",\\\\n39: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\\\\\\\"\\\\n40: \\\\t]}\\\\n41: />\\\\n42: \\\\n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\\\\n44: <Culture {values} />\\\\n45: \\\\n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\\\\n47: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n48: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"team\\\\\\\"\\\\n49: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Our team.\\\\\\\"\\\\n50: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Your partners in innovation.\\\\\\\"\\\\n51: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n52: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n53: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Alex Morgan\\\\\\\",\\\\n54: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Founder & CEO\\\\\\\",\\\\n55: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\\\\\\\",\\\\n56: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n57: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n58: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n59: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n60: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Jamie Chen\\\\\\\",\\\\n61: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Chief Design Officer\\\\\\\",\\\\n62: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\\\\\\\",\\\\n63: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n64: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n65: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n66: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n67: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Taylor Wright\\\\\\\",\\\\n68: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Head of Engineering\\\\\\\",\\\\n69: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\\\\\\\",\\\\n70: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n71: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n72: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n73: \\\\t]}\\\\n74: />\\\\n75: \\\\n76: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n77: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"investor\\\\\\\"\\\\n78: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Backed by the best.\\\\\\\"\\\\n79: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\\\\\\\"\\\\n80: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n81: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n82: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Point Nine Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n83: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\\\\\\\"\\\\n84: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n85: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n86: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"TSIC Ventures\\\\\\\",\\\\n87: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\\\\\\\"\\\\n88: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n89: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n90: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Sequoia Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n91: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\\\\\\\"\\\\n92: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n93: \\\\t]}\\\\n94: />\\\\n95: \\\\n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\\\\n97: <CallToAction\\\\n98: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Ready to collaborate?\\\\\\\"\\\\n99: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Let's create something amazing\\\\\\\"\\\\n100: \\\\tdescription=\\\\\\\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\\\\\\\"\\\\n101: />\\\\n102: \\\"\"},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh\",\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"write_copy\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"topic\\\":\\\"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \\\\n\\\\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\\\\n\\\\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership.

It's important to note that choosing an H1 like this may potentially alienate a subset of people. Muse weighed the pros and cons and decided that the pros won out (and I would agree).\\nThis promise of simplicity for website and ecommerce creation is compelling. There are countless tools in the space and most have their fair share of annoyances and quirks.\\nOverall, Muse's H1 effectively communicates their core value proposition, making complicated website and ecommerce creation accessible to users of all technical skill levels.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Go beyond your mind’s limitations</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nLimitless's headline \\\"Go beyond your mind's limitations\\\" was a scroll-stopper.\\nThe phrase \\\"Go beyond\\\" is an active call to action, encouraging readers to push themselves further. It implies movement and progress, which can be highly motivating.\\nBy referencing \\\"your mind's limitations,\\\" the headline acknowledges that people often feel constrained by their own mental barriers. This recognition of a common human experience can resonate strongly with many individuals.\\nThe headline does a great job of tapping into the widespread desire for self-improvement and personal growth. It suggests that Limitless can help users transcend their current mental state or capabilities.\\nThe headline remains open-ended and applicable to various aspects of one's mental performance, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or overall memory. This broad appeal likely attract a wide range of users with different goals.\\nBy focusing on overcoming limitations rather than specific skills, the headline avoids pigeonholing the product. It suggests that Limitless can be beneficial regardless of a person's starting point or current areas of struggle.\\nThe use of \\\"your\\\" personalizes the message, which is always a marketing win. This makes it feel more directly relevant to each individual that comes across it. It suggests that Limitless can and will be tailored to each person's unique needs.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises personal transformation and growth in a concise, powerful statement. It addresses a universal human desire to improve and overcome limitations, positioning Limitless as a tool for unlocking one's full potential.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The journal that reflects with you</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nPearl's headline \\\"The journal that reflects with you\\\" is a marketing headline that works partly due to the use of italics.\\nThe word \\\"reflects\\\" carries a clever double meaning here. It suggests both the act of personal reflection (as one does when journaling) and the idea that the journal is responsive or actually participates with you.\\nBy saying \\\"with you\\\" rather than \\\"for you,\\\" the headline implies partnership and collaboration. It suggests that Pearl isn't just a passive tool but an active participant in the journaling process. The use of italics on \\\"with\\\" really drives this point home here.\\nThe use of \\\"the\\\" rather than \\\"a\\\" to start the headline positions Pearl as the definitive journaling solution. This subtle choice suggests a level of authority in the crowded journaling space.\\nThe headline avoids technical language about AI even though it is implied, instead focusing on the emotional and personal aspect of journaling. This keeps the technology in the background while emphasizing the human experience.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Pearl not as just another journaling app but as a thoughtful companion in the reflection process. It promises a more interactive and meaningful journaling experience without being overly technical or losing the personal touch that makes journaling special.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>The future of storytelling starts here.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nIncention's marketing headline \\\"The future of storytelling starts here.\\\" in all caps and bold font really stands out and immediately stops your scroll.\\n\\\"The future\\\" suggests that they're leading a transformation in storytelling rather than just iterating on existing methods.\\n\\\"Starts here\\\" creates immediacy and makes the user potential feel like they're at the beginning of something significant. It invites them to be part of this future.\\nBy using \\\"storytelling\\\", the headline maintains broad appeal while expanding the tool's target market beyond just content creation.\\nFinally, the period adds confidence to the statement, implying certainty about Incention's role in shaping storytelling's future.\\nMic drop.\\nFrom their Twitter/X:\\nOur Manifesto: The future of storytelling starts here.\\nNot with algorithms replacing humans, but with technology empowering creators.\\nNot fear of what AI might do, but excitement for what we can achieve together.\\nNot winner-take-all or most, but positive sum collaboration.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Email for you. Yes, you.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nButtondown's headline \\\"Email for you. Yes, you.\\\" immediately grabbed my attention and made me stop and question what this truly meant.\\nThe direct messaging of \\\"you\\\" creates an immediate personal connection. The repetition and emphasis with \\\"Yes, you\\\" makes it even more intimate, as if Buttondown is starting a one-on-one conversation with the reader/potential user.\\nThis same addition of \\\"Yes, you\\\" cleverly anticipates and addresses potential skepticism. It's as if Buttondown is saying \\\"Yes, we really did make this for someone like you,\\\" making the reader feel specifically considered and valued.\\nThe simplicity of \\\"Email for you\\\" suggests that Buttondown has stripped away complexity in an often confusing and feature-packed industry of email.\\nNow, I will say that I knew what Buttondown did before stumbling across this headline. I do think it's possibly a bit too vague without the use of a subheading for those that are not already familiar.\\nIs this for newsletters? A Gmail replacement? A subheading would help clear this up so that the H1 is even more powerful.\\nIn Buttondown's words:\\nHistorically, we've called Buttondown a 'newsletter tool' — the h1 before this was 'The best way to start and grow your newsletter.' This was really nice and effective, but I talked with a number of folks who felt a little turned off by that word \\\"newsletter\\\", as if it felt amateurish or insufficiently \\\"haha business\\\" (for lack of a better term) for their use case.\\nSo I started toying around with replacing \\\"newsletter\\\" with \\\"email\\\" as the proper noun that we'd rally around (and email has its own baggage, to be clear — there's a handful of people who sign up thinking that we're, like, a Proton Mail alternative.) And the more I liked \\\"email\\\", the more I hated \\\"email <buzzword>\\\" — email automation, email marketing, email campaigns all felt very corporate and stodgy in a way that betrayed the unique voice I think most of our marketing copy has. Eventually I landed on \\\"email for people like you\\\", which I liked but lacked... a certain punch, if you know what I mean.\\nFinally, I was batting around ideas and landed on the current two-sentence structure, which I think accomplishes a handful of things:\\n1. Tells the user, frankly, nothing about our product or positioning besides \\\"email\\\" (and therefore invites them to learn more)\\n2. Immediately gives us a certain voice and friendliness that is, uh, _missing_ from the Constant Contacts of the world.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Calm your mind. Change your life.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCalm's marketing headline \\\"Calm your mind. Change your life.\\\" is a compelling H1 that stands out in an increasingly competitive landscape of meditation and mindfulness apps. Here's why this H1 helps Calm remain at the top of the pack:\\nEstablishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship between mental calm and life improvement.\\nThe parallel structure of two short commands creates a memorable rhythm.\\nOpens with \\\"Calm\\\" which reinforces the brand name while also stating the primary benefit.\\nThe periods create deliberate pauses that mirror the mindful breathing the app promotes.\\nProgresses from an immediate and achievable action to a significant long-term benefit.\\nBalances simplicity with profound impact which helps suggest an accessible transformation.\\nDirectly addresses the potential user with active verbs that encourage immediate action.\\nThe brevity of both phrases reflects the simplicity and clarity that meditation provides. Breathe in. Breathe out.\\nAvoids meditation jargon which helps in appealing to beginners who may be intimidated at the thought of meditation and starting a new journey.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A marketing team in your browser</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAstral's marketing headline \\\"A marketing team in your browser\\\" is a thought-provoking H1 that had me instantly putting my email onto the waitlist.\\nAdding \\\"marketing team\\\" suggests a full range of capabilities rather than just individual or one-off marketing tasks. It implies that Astral will be able to replicate the varying skills and functions of an entire team.\\nBy specifying \\\"in your browser,\\\" the headline emphasizes accessibility and convenience. It suggests that powerful marketing capabilities are just a click away, without need for multiple tools.\\nThe simplicity of the headline makes a bold promise without overselling. It's straightforward about what it it plans to offer while implying significant value - having an entire team's capabilities readily available.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it promises all of the capabilities of an entire marketing team in an accessible format that we're all likely familiar with. While there is still limited information on the landing page, the headline itself hints that this will be powerful enough for organizations to use while also being simple enough for individuals.\\nWill they be able to execute on this promise? TBD… but the headline alone is what had me handing over my email without a second thought.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A camera for your mind</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nVisual Electric's marketing headline \\\"A camera for your mind\\\" is creative and thought provoking. There's an element of magic or wonder in it.\\nThe metaphor of a \\\"camera\\\" is particularly powerful. It suggests capturing and preserving something. By pairing it with \\\"mind,\\\" it elevates the concept beyond physical photography to something more imaginative and expansive.\\nBy using \\\"your mind,\\\" the headline also makes it personal while suggesting that Visual Electric can somehow capture internal thoughts and ideas. This bridges the gap between imagination and creation.\\nThe headline sidesteps any mention of AI or image generation. Instead, it uses the familiar concept and tool of a camera to help users understand a more complex internet-y tool, making it much more approachable.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it creates an immediate understanding of the tool's purpose while maintaining a sense of wonder/mystery. It positions Visual Electric not just as another AI image generator but as a tool that can capture and visualize your actual imagination itself. The metaphor is both practical and poetic, making it memorable and intriguing to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Customer relationship magic.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nAttio's headline \\\"Customer relationship magic.\\\" is a simple marketing headline. But that's why it's engaging.\\nIn just three words, the headline communicates both what the product deals with (customer relationships) and how it approaches them (with \\\"magic\\\"). This conciseness suggests the simplicity that Attio hopes to bring to relationship management.\\nThe word \\\"magic\\\" is doing the heavy lifting here. It suggests that Attio can transform the potentially complex and tedious job of managing customer relationships into something effortless and possibly even delightful.\\nBy pairing \\\"Customer relationship\\\" with \\\"magic,\\\" the headline takes a typically dry and business-focused concept and makes it more appealing. In an age where everything is AI-this and AI-that, this is likely a helpful combo for companies looking to innovate on old and outdated practices/software.\\nThe period at the end gives the headline a sense of finality and confidence. It's not promising \\\"magical\\\" results or using \\\"magic\\\" as an adjective - it's stating that what they offer IS magic, full stop.\\nFinally, this headline avoids any technical jargon or buzzwords commonly associated with CRM systems. Instead, it opts for a more emotional and engaging approach. This approach can make the product feel more accessible and appealing.\\nTake a note from Attio's playbook and make your headline magical.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your shortcut to everything.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nRaycast's H1 \\\"Your shortcut to everything\\\" is a powerful and effective marketing headline that immediately made us stop and read on.\\nThe headline leverages the universally appealing concept of efficiency. The word \\\"shortcut\\\" immediately communicates that it can save users time and effort. In our fast-paced digital world, the promise of quicker and easier ways to accomplish tasks is highly attractive to many consumers.\\n\\\"Everything\\\" is a bold and ambitious term that piques curiosity. It suggests that Raycast has an incredibly wide range of applications, making it a versatile tool that can address multiple needs — regardless of who you are. This breadth of utility implies high value for potential users as they hope to replace several tools with just one.\\nThe use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message, making it feel more direct and relevant to each individual reader. It implies that Raycast can be customized to fit the user's specific needs, rather than being a one-size-fits-all solution.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Refreshingly simple project management.</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nEveryone is familiar with Basecamp. But that doesn't mean that they don't need a great H1.\\nTheir current headline, \\\"Refreshingly simple project management,\\\" works exceptionally well for several reasons:\\nThis headline addresses a common pain point in project management — complexity. Many project management tools are notorious for being overly complicated, with steep learning curves that can (and do) overwhelm new users. By using the word \\\"simple\\\" Basecamp immediately positions itself as a solution to this common problem, appealing to those who are frustrated with convoluted systems.\\nThe use of \\\"refreshingly\\\" is also effective. It suggests that Basecamp's approach is not just simple but also going against the norm. This simple word implies that other project management tools are not simple.\\nFinally, the headline is concise and straightforward which aligns perfectly with the message it's conveying. By using only four words, Basecamp demonstrates its commitment to simplicity right from the first interaction a potential customer has with the brand. This consistency between message and delivery strengthens the headline's impact and increases its credibility.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Conquer communication chaos</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCampsite's H1 of \\\"Conquer communication chaos\\\" is a short yet effective headline.\\nThe use of \\\"conquer\\\" and \\\"chaos\\\" makes the headline more memorable. Each word sounds the exact same when starting out as well — c c c — this helps the phrase stick in the reader's mind, increasing brand recall over time.\\n\\\"Conquer\\\" is a strong verb that evokes images of victory and mastery. It suggests that by using Campsite, users will gain control over their communication challenges. This empowering message appeals to professionals who feel overwhelmed by their current communication systems (ahem… Slack).\\n\\\"Communication chaos\\\" accurately identifies a common pain point in many workplaces. It acknowledges the frustration many people feel with disorganized and \\\"always on\\\" communication channels. By calling out this problem problem, Campsite immediately resonates with a large audience.\\nThis headline implies a transformation from a state of disorder to one of control. This promise of positive change is likely to attract potential users who are seeking solutions to improve their work processes and productivity.\\n10/10 headline.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Your ticket to stress-free flying</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFlighty's headline \\\"Your ticket to stress-free flying\\\" is a clever and effective marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"ticket\\\" is a brilliant addition in the context of air travel. It immediately connects the app to the flying experience while also implying that using Flighty is as essential to a smooth journey as having your actual flight ticket.\\n\\\"Stress-free\\\" directly addresses a major pain point for many travelers. Flying is often associated with anxiety, uncertainty, hassle, and delays. By promising a stress-free experience, Flighty positions itself as a solution to these common travel woes. This speaks directly to the emotional needs of potential users.\\nCompleting the phrase \\\"stress-free flying\\\" creates a compelling vision of what air travel could be like with Flighty's help. It taps into the aspirational aspect of product marketing — people aren't just buying an app — they're buying into the idea of a more relaxed, enjoyable travel experience.\\nFinally, the use of \\\"Your\\\" personalizes the message. This makes it feel like Flighty is offering each individual user their own key to a better travel experience. This personal touch can make the app feel more accessible and relevant to potential users.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Like the sales assistant your team never had</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nFolk's marketing headline \\\"Like the sales assistant your team never had\\\" is a relatable situation and pitch.\\nBeginning the H1 with \\\"Like\\\" creates an immediate analogy that helps users understand Folk's core function. It frames the tool in human terms rather than technical features, making its value more relatable.\\nBy referencing \\\"sales assistant,\\\" the headline clearly positions Folk as a tool for sales teams while implying it handles administrative or support tasks. This suggests it frees up salespeople to focus on more important work.\\nAKA… spending less time on busy work.\\nEnding the H1 with \\\"Your team never had\\\" implies Folk fills a gap or solves a problem that teams have been experiencing. It suggests the tool provides something missing, addressing an unmet need rather than just improving an existing process.\\nFinally, the headline avoids technical jargon about CRM features or data management. Instead, it focuses on the human role Folk plays in supporting sales teams, making it easier to connect with immediately.\\nOverall, this headline is effective because it positions Folk as a human-like assistant rather than just another sales tool.\\nCome for the CRM, stay for the sales assistant.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCentral's headline \\\"Payroll, benefits and government bullsh*t for startups\\\" is a bold and refreshingly honest marketing headline.\\nThe use of \\\"bullsh*t\\\" is deliberately provocative and authentic. It stands out and stops the scroll immediately. It acknowledges what many startup founders and operators truly feel about administrative tasks. They're bullsh*t. This honesty can create an immediate connection with the target audience.\\nBy listing \\\"Payroll, benefits and government\\\" before the expletive, the headline establishes credibility first before adding personality. This structure shows they understand the serious nature of these services while empathizing with their customers' frustrations.\\nTargeting \\\"for startups\\\" immediately identifies their core audience. There's no confusion here.\\nThis headline is effective because it strikes a delicate balance between professionalism and personality. It clearly communicates what Central does while using language that resonates with their target audience. The bold word choice makes the headline memorable and helps position Central as a company that understands startup culture and pain points.\\nHowever, like any headline using strong or edgy language, it does risk alienating some potential customers who might prefer more traditional corporate communication.\\nPros and cons… but in this case the pros likely outweigh the cons.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<headline>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<h1>A discovery engine for creatives</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<description>\\nCosmos's headline \\\"A discovery engine for creatives\\\" is a thought provoking headline that subtly addresses a common challenge for creatives – finding new ideas or inspirations. This works for a few reasons.\\nThe term \\\"discovery engine\\\" is novel and intriguing. It suggests that Cosmos is more than just a search tool – it's a system designed to uncover new and unexpected things. This phrasing elevates the product beyond a simple database or search engine.\\nBy specifically targeting creatives (one of their target markets cycled through) the headline immediately identifies and appeals to its core audience. This focus helps creatives quickly recognize that Cosmos is a tool designed with their needs in mind.\\nThe headline taps into the constant need for fresh inspiration and new ideas in creative fields. By positioning itself as a discovery tool, Cosmos aligns with the creative process of finding unexpected connections and inspiration.\\nThere's an implied promise of serendipity and surprise in this headline. For creatives who often seek out new inspirations and unconventional ideas, this suggestion of discovery is particularly appealing.\\nOverall, this is a thought provoking headline that leaves a potential user wanting more.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</description>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</headline>\\n\\t\\t</headline-examples>\\n   </headline-examples>\\n\\n   Do not use words from the banlist.\\n   <banlist>\\n   Bustling,\\nHarnessing,\\nUnveiling the power,\\nRealm,\\nDepicted,\\nDemistify,\\nInsurmountable,\\nNew Era,\\nPoised,\\nUnravel,\\nEntanglement,\\nUnprecedented,\\nEerie connection,\\nunliving,\\nBeacon,\\nUnleash,\\nDelve,\\nEnrich,\\nMultifaced,\\nElevate,\\nDiscover,\\nSupercharge,\\nUnlock,\\nUnleash,\\nTailored,\\nElegant,\\nDelve,\\nDive,\\nEver-evolving,\\npride,\\nRealm,\\nMeticulously,\\nGrappling,\\nWeighing,\\nPicture,\\nArchitect,\\nAdventure,\\nJourney,\\nEmbark,\\nNavigate,\\nNavigation,\\ndazzle,\\ntapestry,\\nRevolutionize,\\naugmented reality,\\nAR\\n   </banlist>\\n\\n  </writing_guide>\\n\\n## Mockup Tool\\n\\nYou are provided with a mockup tool which can be used to generate mockups to be used in images for the website.\\n\\nYou should always try to mix and match regular customer images with mockups so the site is always interesting and you break the pattern.\\n\\nThe mockup tool can currently generate the following mockups:\\n- airport-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a customer image inside an airport billboard.\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page.\\n\\n- dark-screen\\nThis mockup is a mockup of the company name and logo with a dark accent color background on a dark conference room screen\\nThis is best used in a hero section of an about page or careers page but of a dark mode website since this mockup is super dark, and will be too distracting on a light mode website.\\n\\n\\nMake sure to not use the same mockup in different places.\\n\\nRemember - you dont HAVE to always use the mockup tool, but you have the option to use it if you think it will help you create a better website and tel the story better.\\n\\n\\nYou will also be given a hero style for the hero section of the home page.\\nIf you're given a hero style which has left aligned or center aligned text, you need to use the correct hero and pass the prop (centered) correctly.\\n\\n- Make sure to use the correct hero style and import it and not hallucinate it.\\n- If in doubt, just use the default hero, or else use the ask_questions_to_codebase tool to ask the user for help.\\n- Always read the hero file to understand the props and how to use it correctly (centered, title, subtitle, image, testimonials, etc)\\n\\n## Company context\\nYou are building websites specifically for:\\n<company_context>\\nCompany name:\\nProbook\\n\\nWhat does the company do, in one sentence?

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\\\\\\\",\\\\n38: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\\\\\\\",\\\\n39: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\\\\\\\"\\\\n40: \\\\t]}\\\\n41: />\\\\n42: \\\\n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\\\\n44: <Culture {values} />\\\\n45: \\\\n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\\\\n47: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n48: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"team\\\\\\\"\\\\n49: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Our team.\\\\\\\"\\\\n50: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Your partners in innovation.\\\\\\\"\\\\n51: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n52: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n53: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Alex Morgan\\\\\\\",\\\\n54: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Founder & CEO\\\\\\\",\\\\n55: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\\\\\\\",\\\\n56: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n57: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n58: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n59: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n60: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Jamie Chen\\\\\\\",\\\\n61: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Chief Design Officer\\\\\\\",\\\\n62: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\\\\\\\",\\\\n63: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n64: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n65: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n66: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n67: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Taylor Wright\\\\\\\",\\\\n68: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tposition: \\\\\\\"Head of Engineering\\\\\\\",\\\\n69: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tbio: \\\\\\\"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\\\\\\\",\\\\n70: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage:\\\\n71: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\\\\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\\\\\\\"\\\\n72: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n73: \\\\t]}\\\\n74: />\\\\n75: \\\\n76: <StakeholderGrid\\\\n77: \\\\tstakeholderType=\\\\\\\"investor\\\\\\\"\\\\n78: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Backed by the best.\\\\\\\"\\\\n79: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\\\\\\\"\\\\n80: \\\\tstakeholders={[\\\\n81: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n82: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Point Nine Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n83: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\\\\\\\"\\\\n84: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n85: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n86: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"TSIC Ventures\\\\\\\",\\\\n87: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\\\\\\\"\\\\n88: \\\\t\\\\t},\\\\n89: \\\\t\\\\t{\\\\n90: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\tname: \\\\\\\"Sequoia Capital\\\\\\\",\\\\n91: \\\\t\\\\t\\\\timage: \\\\\\\"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\\\\\\\"\\\\n92: \\\\t\\\\t}\\\\n93: \\\\t]}\\\\n94: />\\\\n95: \\\\n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\\\\n97: <CallToAction\\\\n98: \\\\ttitle=\\\\\\\"Ready to collaborate?\\\\\\\"\\\\n99: \\\\tsubtitle=\\\\\\\"Let's create something amazing\\\\\\\"\\\\n100: \\\\tdescription=\\\\\\\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\\\\\\\"\\\\n101: />\\\\n102: \\\"\"},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh\",\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"write_copy\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"topic\\\":\\\"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \\\\n\\\\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\\\\n\\\\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).

No exporting, syncing, or spreadsheets—just decisions you can trust.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>From revenue to readiness, see it all</h2>\\\\n<ul>\\\\n  <li><strong>Tech performance:</strong> See sales per call type and identify who needs support, not just who brings in dollars.</li>\\\\n  <li><strong>Call length accuracy:</strong> Stop guessing. We predict how long every job will take based on real behavior.</li>\\\\n  <li><strong>Geographic revenue:</strong> Identify which zip codes perform, so marketing dollars go further.</li>\\\\n  <li><strong>7-day view:</strong> Monitor board capacity and set alerts for when thresholds are hit.</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Serious results, fast</h2>\\\\n<p>Our customers average 12% higher sales and 19% more flips—and they were already dispatching for profit.</p>\\\\n<p>Probook helps some companies operate at an industry-leading 25:1 tech to dispatcher ratio.</p>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>You’re never left to figure it out</h2>\\\\n<ul>\\\\n  <li>In-person, 2-day launch with CEO support</li>\\\\n  <li>Twice-weekly follow-ups to track ROI and performance</li>\\\\n  <li>24/7 support in your tool of choice (Slack, Teams, or text)</li>\\\\n</ul>\\\\n\\\\n<h2>Loved by top-performing teams</h2>\\\\n<p>\\\\\\\"We used to assign with our gut.

Day after day, we watched opportunities fall through the cracks and teams stretched too thin. We weren’t alone. Nearly every home services company we connected with had the same struggle: great people, poor tools, and no clear way to reliably send the right tech to the right call.\",\n38: \t\t\"So we built something better. With firsthand experience guiding us, we created Probook—dispatching software designed to support the real work of running a field team. It’s grounded in practical workflows, synced in real time with ServiceTitan, and offers two levels of automation that support—even strengthen—human decision-making. Most importantly, we didn’t just ship software; we showed up, sat next to real dispatchers, and built around what they actually needed.\",\n39: \t\t\"Now Probook powers top dispatch teams across the country—from companies managing 25+ techs per dispatcher, to startups ready to grow with confidence. Customers see 12% more revenue, a 19% increase in flipped calls, and their dispatchers finally have tools they trust. We're here for the long haul—with hands-on support from day one and 24/7 availability that feels like a true partnership. Because we don't just believe in smarter dispatching—we believe in the people behind it.\"\n40: \t]}\n41: />\n42: \n43: <!-- Our Culture Section -->\n44: <Culture {values} />\n45: \n46: <!-- StakeholderGrid Section -->\n47: <StakeholderGrid\n48: \tstakeholderType=\"team\"\n49: \ttitle=\"Our team.\"\n50: \tsubtitle=\"Your partners in innovation.\"\n51: \tstakeholders={[\n52: \t\t{\n53: \t\t\tname: \"Alex Morgan\",\n54: \t\t\tposition: \"Founder & CEO\",\n55: \t\t\tbio: \"Started the company with a vision to transform the industry through innovative solutions.\",\n56: \t\t\timage:\n57: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560250097-0b93528c311a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n58: \t\t},\n59: \t\t{\n60: \t\t\tname: \"Jamie Chen\",\n61: \t\t\tposition: \"Chief Design Officer\",\n62: \t\t\tbio: \"Award-winning designer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful experiences.\",\n63: \t\t\timage:\n64: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496359142-b8d87734a5a2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=776&q=80\"\n65: \t\t},\n66: \t\t{\n67: \t\t\tname: \"Taylor Wright\",\n68: \t\t\tposition: \"Head of Engineering\",\n69: \t\t\tbio: \"Technology enthusiast focused on building scalable systems that make a difference.\",\n70: \t\t\timage:\n71: \t\t\t\t\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=774&q=80\"\n72: \t\t}\n73: \t]}\n74: />\n75: \n76: <StakeholderGrid\n77: \tstakeholderType=\"investor\"\n78: \ttitle=\"Backed by the best.\"\n79: \tsubtitle=\"Point Nine, TSIC and others\"\n80: \tstakeholders={[\n81: \t\t{\n82: \t\t\tname: \"Point Nine Capital\",\n83: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/pointnine.com/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1id_elLz2Bd5Ej-dWo7\"\n84: \t\t},\n85: \t\t{\n86: \t\t\tname: \"TSIC Ventures\",\n87: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/tiny.vc/w/400/h/400/logo?c=1a2b3c4d5e\"\n88: \t\t},\n89: \t\t{\n90: \t\t\tname: \"Sequoia Capital\",\n91: \t\t\timage: \"https://cdn.brandfetch.io/sequoiacap.com/w/400/h/400/logo\"\n92: \t\t}\n93: \t]}\n94: />\n95: \n96: <!-- CTA Section -->\n97: <CallToAction\n98: \ttitle=\"Ready to collaborate?\"\n99: \tsubtitle=\"Let's create something amazing\"\n100: \tdescription=\"Join the companies already leveraging our expertise to transform their digital presence and achieve their business goals.\"\n101: />\n102: "}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"call_7KQXEKPHiERYC42c30rW2Yyh","toolName":"write_copy","args":{"topic":"Purpose: Update the company culture section to fit Probook, which builds AI-powered dispatching software for home services companies. \n\nTone: Direct, supportive, grounded, and human-focused.\n\nTarget Audience: Dispatchers, dispatch managers, and leadership at home services companies (HVAC, plumbing, sewer, electrical, etc).
